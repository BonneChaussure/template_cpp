# C++ template

# 🧱 How to Use This C++ Template for New Projects

This repository serves as a base C++ project template. Follow the steps below to clone and reuse it for other projects, solo or in group work with **vscode**.

- Clone this template in your folder : 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BonneChaussure/template_cpp.git
```

- Once cloned rename the folder as you wish.

This project uses ```clang``` and ```Cmake```, so you will need to install some extensions : 
* clangd from LLVM
* Clang-Format from Xavier Hellauer
* Cmake Tools from Microsoft
* Some C++ extension like C/C++ from Microsoft

You will need to download dependencies are required, you can use this command : 
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```
Or you can install them manualy. This command will install : 
-  clang (as a complier), doxygen (for autodocumentation), cmake and make (and homebrew for macos if not already installed)


# ⚙️ Build Instructions

- To build your c++ code, use this command : 
```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

- The command above will (by default) build your project in **Debug** mode.
- To build in **Release** mode, just specify it : 
```bash
./scripts/build.sh Release
```

- Once the compilation is done, you can find your complied file in ```/delivery/<COMPILE_MODE>/<YOUR_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR>/```

- Finaly, to **rename** your compliled file, you need to got to the ```CMakeLists.txt``` file and change this line : 
```project(MyCppProject VERSION 1.0 LANGUAGES CXX)```

# 🔧 Other Instructions

- To generate the documentation of your code, use this command : 
```bash
./scripts/generate_docs.sh
```

- To clean your project directory, use this command : 
```bash
./scripts/clean_full.sh
```
This will delete : ```delivery/```, ```build/``` and ```docs/``` (and .cache/ folder if there is one).
